## Introduction

This was the first course project for my Linear Algebra class at Amirkabir University of Technology's Computer Engineering faculty.

**Being available for both iOS and Android was a joke.**
Just to make this MD more elaborate. Needed for my Internet Engineering class.

## Features

A few of the things you can do with GitPoint:

* Decomposes a matrix
* ...
* That's it

## Feedback

Feel free to send us feedback here. I won't mind updating this.

## Build Process
No build. Just run this with your python interperter of choice.
